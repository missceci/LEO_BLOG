            <p>Chicago is an excellent place. It was a very fun experience, with interesting museums, tall buildings, 
              and more. I especially liked the activities where you could go to the highest point of a building and look down. 
              It was really cool. And the deep dish pizza there was delicious. I also saw the Bean which was a 
              really pretty sculpture that I saw and I could reccomend. Overall this was a really good trip.

            <h5 class="text_success">I visited Georgia in 2021</h5>
            <p>Georgia was a fun experience. I might not have remembered everything I did or saw, but what I do remember, it was amazing.
              I remember seeing the fourth of july fireworks there, which were amazing, and saw a coca cola factory. They were
              both fun experiences, but my favorite activity was definetely the world's biggest aquarium that we went to there. It was
              humongus, and spectacular, I would stroungly reccomend this. This was an excellent trip.

            <h5 class="text_success">I visited Japan in 2024</h5>
            <p>Chicago and Georgia were fun experiences, but by far my favorite place that I visited was Japan. The culture,
              the shrines, the food, the anime, everthing was unique and interesting. The activities I did there was exploring Japan's shrines,
              and doing activities such as teamLab, and just exploring the cities. This trip was long and included a lot of walking,
              and a lot of shrines, but was worth it.

              <p>There are many reasons I like this movie. It has action, a good story, and interesting characters.
                It did not disappoint, and was a good watch. I would reccomend this movie to people who like a good
                story, and don't mind there being more story than action. It was well worth the visit.
